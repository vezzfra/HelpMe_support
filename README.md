# HelpMe: Support Service
An iOS mutual help application. 

HelpMe born from the idea that the world always had two types of people: 
      - People that need help;
      - People that want to help.
    
HelpMe is an application for mutual support between users. It gives to the users the possibility to contact an 'Helper' and talk anonimously about his problems.
This can be done in three ways:
    - Through the HelpLine that was opened on a Whatsapp Professional account;
    - Through a dedicated email;
    - Through the live anonymous chat provided by the application;
